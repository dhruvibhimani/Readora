# Readora
A website specially for Book readers which help them get the suggestion for books .It is a functional website where users can find books from different genre get suggestion based on past reading and read quotes ,blogs about books and daily life .
It does not yet have feature of getting suggestion based on mood and enviroment but I am planning to include it in future (Which makes it different from the other boring boook sites which are just made for visiting once ,though this will increase user engagement as it also have a suggestion box where people can suggest books)
Tech used : ReactJs, Tailwind CSS
